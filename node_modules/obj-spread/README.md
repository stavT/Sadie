To create this package, I read this cool article: https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c

In a nutshell, to publish:

* increase the version in package.json
* `npm test`
* `npm publish` - this will also run the `npm prepare` before publishing

If it requests login, do `npm login` and try again

A simple, but powerful way to extend classes with other classes. You can even extend built-in classes, like `Array` or `String`

# Installation

`npm i obj-spread -S`

# Usage

For example, you want to move all static functions from class `Foo` to internal class `String`. All you need to do is
to create an instance of ObjSpread:

```ts
    new ObjSpread(Foo, String, s=>String(s));
```
Here, the last argument will convert the value to an actual `String` class.
For example, if you want to spread to `Array`, you would do the following:
```ts
    new ObjSpread(Foo, String, a=>[].concat(a));
```
In case if you don't need to convert anything, just do `a=>a`.
